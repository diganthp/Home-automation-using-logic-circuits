# Home Automation without using Microcontroller
In todayâ€™s world there is an increasing need for intelligent power saving, use of renewable sources, to make devices smarter and better. Home automation may include control of lighting, fans, appliances, and other systems, to provide more convenience comfort power saving and security. Several researchers are exploring this area. This review focuses on the use of technology to have centralized control of appliances to build a smarter home. This review explores the functioning of a microcontroller, to understand its working and find alternative ways to build a logic circuit without the use of microcontroller. An overview of the challenges faced, proposed solutions and the final outcome of it. This is a vast field for research and development (R&D) and its advancement can be used in internet of things (IOT).
